# Quip CLI

This package contains the Quip command line interface, which is used for interacting with the Quip Live Apps platform.

## Running locally

When developing locally, you'll iterate by calling `bin/run <your-command>`.

## Adding new commands

This tool uses [oclif](https://oclif.io/) to handle arg parsing and user interactivity.

To add a command to this repo, run `npx oclif command <name>`. For other options, check `npx oclif --help`
